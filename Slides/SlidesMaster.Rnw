\begin{itemize}
\item
This presentation is based upon Capital in the 21st century (Harvard University Press, March 2014)
\item
This book studies the global dynamics of income and wealth distribution since 18c in 20+ countries; I use historical data collected over the past 15 years with Atkinson, Saez, Postel-Vinay, Rosenthal, Alvaredo, Zucman, and 30+ others; I try to shift attention from rising income inequality to rising wealth inequality
\item
The book includes four parts:
\begin{itemize}
\item
Part 1. Income and capital
\item
Part 2. The dynamics of the capital/income ratio 
\item
Part 3. The structure of inequalities
\item
Part 4. Regulating capital in the 21st century
\end{itemize}
\item 
In this presentation I will present some results from Parts 2 \& 3, focusing upon the long-run evolution of capital/income ratios and wealth concentration (all graphs and series are available on line:
see http://piketty.pse.ens.fr/capital21c)

\begin{enumerate}
\item
The return of a patrimonial (or wealth-based) society in the Old World (Europe, Japan). Wealth-income ratios seem to be returning to very high levels in low growth countries.
\medskip\newline
Intuition: in a slow-growth society, wealth accumulated in the past can naturally become very important. In the very long run, this can be relevant for the entire world.
\item 
The future of wealth concentration: with high r-g during 21c (r = `net-of-tax rate of return', g = `growth rate'), then wealth inequality might reach or surpass 19c oligarchic levels; conversely, suitable institutions can allow to democratize wealth.
\item
Inequality in America (``meritocratic extremism''): is the New World developing a new inequality model that is based upon extreme labor income inequality more than upon wealth inequality? Is it more merit-based, or can it become the worst of all worlds?

\begin{itemize}
\item
Top income shares: income inequality is known to be high in Brasil; but it is probably underestimated (problem with household surveys); little access to fiscal data in Brasil
\item 
Wealth-income ratios: probably a strong rise in Brasil (real estate prices), but we do not really know
\item
Wealth inequality: probably very high, but we do not really know; no access to property tax and inheritance tax statistics
\item
Like other countries, Brasil needs more transparency about income and wealth; progressive tax on income, inheritance and wealth would be a powerful way to produce information about how the different income and wealth groups are benefiting from growth

\frametitle{Conclusions}
\begin{itemize}
\item
The history of income and wealth inequality is always political, chaotic and unpredictable; it involves national identities and sharp reversals; nobody can predict the reversals of the future
\item
Marx: with $g=0$, $\beta\rightarrow\infty$, $r\rightarrow 0$ : revolution, war
\item
My conclusions are less apocalyptic: with $g>0$, at least we have a steady state $\beta=s/g$
\item
But with $g>0$ \& small, this steady-state can be rather gloomy: it can involve a very large capital-income ratio $\beta$ and capital share $\alpha$, as well as extreme wealth concentration due to high $r-g$
\item
This has nothing to do with a market imperfection: the more perfect the capital market, the higher $r-g$
\item
The ideal solution: progressive wealth tax at the global scale, based upon automatic exchange of bank information
\item
Other solutions involve authoritarian political \& capital controls (China, Russia..), or perpetual population growth (US), or inflation, or some mixture of all
\end{itemize}
